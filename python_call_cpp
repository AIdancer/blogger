1. finish your cpp class file.
2. add corresponding extern "C" function. (That means you should disign the function in C way by using the cpp API)
3. for example, we have show.h and show.cpp. And there is corresponding C API to C++ class and function.
   Then, g++ -fPIC -c show.cpp -o show.o
         g++ -shared show.o -o libshow.so
   After that, we call use the libshow.so in python, or call its extern "C" function in C file(Remember to -L, -l and load the
   write library).
4. To load python module
   from ctypes import *
   libshow = cdll.LoadLibrary('your library path');
   libshow.function(paramter);
   
5. Remeber set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running the program, or it may can not find the .so file.
